main file to run this code is Graph.java
first argument is vertices/nodes and second argument is edges. Default value of Nodes and edges are 4 and 4.
number of nodes should be greater than 1. 
after compilation use below to run and see the result. [compilation order pair.java, RandomGraphGenerator.java, Graph.java]
java Graph 4 6

A jar file is also available to test. Test from jar file
java -jar graph.jar 4 6

 Random weight was generated from 1 to number of nodes from input
 Random values are used for source and target to generate the shortest path and run the Dijkstra Algorithm
 
 eccentricity was calculated for each vertices.
